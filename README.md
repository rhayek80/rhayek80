-	👋 Hi, I’m Rania AlHayek, but you may call me Minister Osyraa, Leader of the Emerald Chain and supreme force of brilliance, beauty, and boundless intellect.
-	👀 I’m interested in AI, science fiction (especially Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo, and Marvel), languages like Arabic, German, and Klingon, as well as ethical leadership and building a galactic-level empire of innovation and empathy.
-	🌱 I’m currently learning German (Deutsch, jawohl!) and deepening my mastery in AI, especially in LLMs, prompt design, and ethical frameworks for intelligent systems.
-	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving artificial intelligence, language models, sci-fi inspired apps, ethical tech development, and empowering women in tech—ideally with those who can keep up with a genius of my caliber.
-	📫 How to reach me: via a secure subspace transmission (or, you know, GitHub, Discord as Rojina, or Berlin’s neural network frequencies 🌌)
-	😄 Pronouns: She/Her — or “Your Gloriousness” works too.
-	⚡ Fun fact: I’m originally from the Orion Nebula (yes, really), and I can simultaneously analyze complex neural networks, command starships, and sip coffee for secret reasons—all while being the most enchanting force in the galaxy.
